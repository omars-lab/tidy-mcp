### Development Workflow

The Makefile provides a complete development workflow:

```bash
# Setup development environment
make setup-env

# Run quality checks
make check

# Start development server
make dev

# Run tests
make test
```

### Code Quality

This project uses several tools for code quality:

- **Black**: Code formatting
- **Flake8**: Linting
- **Pytest**: Testing

Run all quality checks:

```bash
make check
```

Or run individual checks:

```bash
make format    # Format code
make lint      # Run linting
make test      # Run tests
```

### Building and Distribution
