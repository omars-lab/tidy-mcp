In the context/NotePlan3/Calendar folder there are files that capture my daily todos.

It is important to note that I may have large initiatives that span multiple days. 
It is also important to understand how I model my tasks. If a mardown task of mine is not indented, it is a parent task. If there is an indented markdown task that has greater indentation than its preceeding task, then the indented task is a child task. This indentation relationship to break a parent task into children subtasks is recursive.

I would like you to generate a markdown report summarizing my tasks for this week.

In the report, I am expecting to see 

a) a different markdown section for each of the main initiatives I am working on. 
b) I would also like you to distinguish my personal initaitves from my work initiatives by prefixing the header for personal initiatives with a house emoji and prefixing work initiative headers with an office emoji. Additionally, one section of the report should group all the personal initiatives and another section should group all the work initiatives.
c) For each initiative, I want you to distinguish completed tasks from outstanding tasks. I want you to ensure you maintain the recursive, heirarchical relationship between child and parent tasks. 
d) In addition, I want you to tag each parent task with a hashtag representing the original date of the file the parent task originated from. 
e) I want you to begin the report outlining all the different noteplan files you analyzed to generate the report.

Additionally, there are some constraits that you must abide by: 

1) Respect the indentation of the tasks / keep the indentation as is. Don't add or remove any indentation.
2) Keep the wording of the tasks as-is. Other than adding the hashtag for the date at the end of a task, do not modify the wording of any of the tasks.
3) Do not create any new tasks.
4) Do not delete any tasks. All tasks in the underlying files should be present in the final report.
